python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py makemigrations mainapp
python manage.py migrate

python manage.py collectstatic

```
now run using `python manage.py runserver`

## Extra Requirements For some Tools

- #### Installing wkhtmltopdf on windows
	- by default the project contained a folder named wkhtmltopdf it will work without installations
	
- #### Installing wkhtmltopdf on linux
	- you could download a version  from  here `https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html`
	 after that replace the folder wkhtmltopdf with your wkhtmltopdf folder you need to have an executable file inside the bin folder 
	 so take care 
   
## Getting A Tool Running
This is a general overview of getting a tool running
1. If there is no admin user, create one using `python manage.py createsuperuser`
2. Start the development server using `python manage.py runserver`
3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and log in with the superuser credentials
4. Add a new user to the database from the admin panel
5. To get a new tool up and running, add its details to the database using the add tool option.
6. The details of the tool can be found in the `tools_data.csv` file. Details like the description can be left blank.
7. Once the tool is saved, it can be accessed from http://127.0.0.1:8000/
